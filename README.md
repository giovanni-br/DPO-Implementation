# Direct Preference Optimization Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a policy optimization method for reinforcement learning that directly optimizes user preferences.

In this repository, we make available the implementation and the experiments that compare DPO with SFT, as well as a report with the full mathematical derivation of the method.

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then, clone the repository:

```bash
